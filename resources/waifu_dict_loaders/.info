WAIFU DICT LOADERS
-----------------

The waifu dict loaders are json serializable dictionaries used to pass and format the information
between the waifu in the database and the commands they are requested at.

A waifu dict loader has a lot of key values, that will be specified below:

# Base dict loader
{
	"title": str,  // The title of the embed
	"image_url": str,  // The image url of the waifu
	"colour": int,  // HEX Value for the colour of the embed
	"description": list(), // Each element is a line in the description
	"fields": dict(),  // Each key is a field name, and the value is the string in the field
	"navigation": int,  // Navigation header
	"waifu_count": int  // How many waifus the user has
}

Most of the values in the dict loader are gathered via the get_waifu_details function, and formatted
accordingly to whatever the command needs.
Depending on the values passed into the dict loader, the embed will have different appearences.

Every command will need to have a dict loader, and the dict loader will be parsed using the waifu_utils.load_waifu_listing
function. That will shape up the embed from the dict loader.
